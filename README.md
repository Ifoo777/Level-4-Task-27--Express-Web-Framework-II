# Level 4 Task 27 -Express Web Framework II

## Task

Follow these steps:

● Create a Restful API using Express that will allow the user to store a list of cars.

○ When the user navigates to ‘http://localhost:3000/api’ an array of car items should be returned.

E.g. of array:[{"id": 1, "make":"Mercedes-Benz", "model": "A-class", "seats": 5}, {"id": 2, "make":"Land Rover", "model": "Defender 90", "seats": 6}]

○ The user should be able to use Postman to make an HTTP Post request that adds an additional item to the list of cars.

○ The user should be able to use Postman to make an HTTP Delete request that deletes an item with a specific id from the list.

○ The user should be able to make an HTTP Put request to update the model or number of seats of a car.

○ Some helpful info on parsing JSON requests can be found here.

● Create a file called readme.md in the project folder of this application that provides the user instructions for testing this API with Postman.
